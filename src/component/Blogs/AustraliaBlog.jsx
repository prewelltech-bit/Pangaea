        Australia Student Visa Update 2026: India’s Evidence Level Change
        Explained
      </h1>

      <p>
        For many international students, studying in Australia represents global
        exposure, career growth, and long-term opportunities such as a
        post-study work visa (Subclass 485) and potential PR pathways.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>8 January 2026</strong>, the Department of Home Affairs (DHA)
        revised Country Evidence Level assessments for South Asia, including
        India. While headlines may sound worrying, genuine students should not
        panic.

        What are Country Evidence Levels?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Country Evidence Levels are part of Australia’s{" "}
        <span className="span">
          risk-based student visa assessment framework
        </span>{" "}
        . They influence:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The <span className="span">type and volume of documents</span>
          required at visa lodgement

      <p>
        Importantly, Country Evidence Levels{" "}

          do not determine visa approval or refusal on their own.

        broader compliance trends{" "}

          — not on individual student intentions or academic merit alone.
