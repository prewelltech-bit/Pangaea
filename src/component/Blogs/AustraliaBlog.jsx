        Australia Student Visa Update 2026: India’s Evidence Level Change
        Explained
      </h1>

      <p>
        For many international students, studying in Australia represents global
        exposure, career growth, and long-term opportunities such as a
        post-study work visa (Subclass 485) and potential PR pathways.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>8 January 2026</strong>, the Department of Home Affairs (DHA)
        revised Country Evidence Level assessments for South Asia, including
        India. While headlines may sound worrying, genuine students should not
        panic.

        What are Country Evidence Levels?

      <p>
        Country Evidence Levels are part of Australia’s{" "}

          risk-based student visa assessment framework
        </span>{" "}
        . They influence:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The <span className="span">type and volume of documents</span>
          required at visa lodgement

      <p>
        Importantly, Country Evidence Levels{" "}

          {" "}
          do not determine visa approval or refusal on their own.

        broader compliance trends{" "}

          — not on individual student intentions or academic merit alone.

        A well-prepared, honest application always carries more weight than

      <h2>How to Verify Your Own Case (Country Evidence Level)?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Visit the DHA Document Checklist Tool</li>
        <li>Select yourCountry of Passport </li>
        <li>Enter your university or CRICOS provider code</li>

      <h4>Important reminder: </h4>
      <h4>
        Re-check the tool just before lodgement, as requirements can change. DHA

      <h2>What If You Have Already Lodged Your Student Visa?</h2>

        Students who lodged their student visa (Subclass 500) application before

      <br />
      <h4>
        Country Evidence Levels are applied at the time of lodgement and are not
        applied retrospectively. If your application was complete when
        submitted, a later Evidence Level change does not automatically affect
        your application.{" "}

      <h4>
        The Department of Home Affairs does not cancel or refuse applications
        solely because a country’s Evidence Level changes after lodgement.
        However, DHA has always retained the right to request additional
        documents if individual concerns arise — this applies across all
        Evidence Levels.{" "}

      <h4>
