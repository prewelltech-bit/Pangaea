        Start Your Business with 485 Visa: Launch Your Entrepreneurship Journey in Australia
      </h1>

      <h2>What is the Subclass 485 Visa?</h2>

      {/* Introduction */}
      <p>
        <span className="span">The Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485)</span> allows international students who have completed eligible studies in Australia to <span className="span"> live, work, and study temporarily.</span>
      </p>

      {/* What is 485 Visa */}
      <h2>There are two main streams:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-graduate-485/post-higher-education-work">Post-Higher Education Work Stream</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-graduate-485/post-vocational-education-work">Post-Vocational Work Stream</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Importantly, this visa provides <span className="span">unrestricted work rights</span> —meaning you can take up full-time employment or <span className="span">start a business</span> in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>This freedom makes the 485 visa a powerful launchpad for entrepreneurship and side hustles.</p>

      {/* Why 485 is Ideal */}
      <h2>Why the 485 Visa is the Ideal Launchpad for a Side Hustle in Australia</h2>

      <h4><span className="span">From Study Mode to Business Mode</span></h4>

      <h4>While on a <span className="span">student visa (Subclass 500)</span>, you were limited to 48 hours of work per fortnight. But on a <span className="span">485 visa</span>, those restrictions are gone, you can dedicate your time fully to employment or business pursuits.</h4>

      <h4><span className="span">Australia’s Entrepreneurial Environment</span></h4>

      <h4>Australia encourages start-ups through accessible <span className="span">ABN registration</span> , tax support, business mentorships, and small-business grants. You can legally register your business and operate as a <span className="span">sole trader, partnership, or company.</span></h4>

      <h4><span className="span">Why a Side Hustle Makes Sense</span></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>You already understand local markets and culture.</li>
        <li>A side hustle lets you test your idea with minimal risk.</li>
        <li>A profitable venture can later evolve into a <span className="span">PR pathway.</span></li>
      </ul>

      {/* Steps Section */}
      <h2>Key Steps to Start a Side Hustle on Your 485 Visa</h2>

      <h3> <span className="span">Step 1 – Check Eligibility & Duration</span></h3>
      <p>
        Confirm your 485 visa stream, conditions, and expiry date. Ensure you remain compliant with Australian immigration rules.
      </p>

      <h3><span className="span">Choose and Register Your Business Structure</span></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Select from <span className="span">sole trader, partnership, or company.</span></li>
        <li>Apply for <span className="span">ABN </span> and <span className="span">TFN</span>.</li>
        <li>Apply for required  <span className="span">permits or licences </span> on business.gov.au.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 3 – Validate Your Idea</h3>
      <p>
        Use local insights, alumni networks, and community groups to test your product-market fit.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4 – Stay Legally Compliant</h3>
      <p>
        Follow taxation, payroll, and superannuation regulations. Maintain transparent records to support any future PR or business visa applications.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 5 – Plan Long-Term Growth</h3>
      <p>
        Your 485 visa is temporary. Build business credibility and plan ahead for transition to a Skilled Migration (189/190/491) visa.
