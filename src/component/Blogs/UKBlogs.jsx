        Can You Change Jobs on a 485 Without Hurting Your PR Plans?
      </h1>

      <p>
        Changing employers while you’re on a Temporary Graduate (subclass 485) visa is common-and in many cases, it’s not the job change that hurts your PR strategy. It’s how the change impacts your <span className="span"> nominated occupation alignment, skills assessment evidence, points claims, and future sponsorship options.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        The 485 is designed to let eligible graduates stay in Australia and work after finishing studies. So job mobility is often part of using your post-study work period wisely, especially if you’re building a pathway toward skilled migration (189/190/491) or employer-sponsored PR (186).
      </p>

      <p>
        What follows is a practical, decision-ready guide that helps you avoid the “quiet mistakes” that can weaken a PR application months later.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The real question isn’t “Can I change employers?” – it’s “Will my new role still count for PR?”
      </h2>

      <p>A 485 holder’s PR plan usually depends on one (or a blend) of these outcomes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Skilled Independent 189, Skilled Nominated 190, Skilled Work Regional 491 via SkillSelect</li>
        <li>Often with location/industry priorities</li>
      </ul>

   <p>
    Where job changes become risky is when they create <span className="span">gaps or inconsistencies</span> in the story your PR pathway needs to tell-especially around occupation, duties, hours, dates, and evidence.
   </p>

   <h2>When changing employers helps your PR strategy</h2>

   <h4><span className="span"></span>Moving into a role that better matches your nominated occupation (ANZSCO alignment)</h4>

   <p>
    Many graduates start in a “bridge job” (admin, retail, generic support) and later move into a role that matches their nominated occupation more clearly (e.g., Developer → Software Engineer duties; Marketing Assistant → Marketing Specialist duties). This kind of switch can strengthen your case-because points and assessments typically care about skilled, relevant work, not just “any Australian work.”
   </p>

   <h4><span className="span">Increasing the quality of your evidence trail</span></h4>

   <p>
    If your next employer provides clearer contracts, consistent payslips, stable hours, and proper role descriptions, you’re making your future PR file easier to prove.
   </p>

   <h4><span className="span"></span>Improving your long-term sponsorship potential</h4>

   <p>
    If employer sponsorship is your goal, moving to a business that has the right structure (and willingness) to sponsor can be a strategic upgrade. (This is also where you want to avoid switching too frequently without a narrative.)
   </p>

   <h2>
    When changing employers can quietly damage your PR case
   </h2>

   <h4>
    Claiming points for work that doesn’t qualify as “skilled employment”
   </h4>

   <p>
    For points-tested skilled visas, the Department’s points rules are strict about what counts as skilled employment. In simple terms: <span className="span">you can only claim points for employment if it was in your nominated skilled occupation or a closely related skilled occupation.</span>
   </p>

   <h4>That means a job change can hurt you if you move into work that:</h4>

   <ul>
    <li>isn’t in your nominated occupation (or closely related),</li>
    <li>can’t be evidenced properly later,</li>
    <li>or looks inconsistent with your claimed pathway.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4><span className="span">Losing continuity needed for employer-sponsored PR planning</span></h4>

   <p>
    Employer-sponsored strategies often rely on <span className="span">continuity with the employer and role</span> (especially for pathways that involve moving from a temporary sponsored visa toward PR). Even if you’re not sponsored today, frequent job hopping can make it harder to secure a sponsor tomorrow—because employers want stability and a clean compliance picture.
   </p>

   <h4>
    <span className="span">
      Creating unexplained gaps, overlaps, or inconsistent dates
    </span>
   </h4>

   <h4>
    PR files get assessed on documentation consistency. Switching jobs often creates:
   </h4>

   <ul>
    <li>a gap between roles,</li>
    <li>overlapping payslips from two employers,</li>
    <li>changes in job titles that don’t match duties,</li>
    <li>mismatched dates across references, payroll summaries, and super records.</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>These are solvable, if you plan for them.</h4>

   <h2>How different PR pathways treat job changes on a 485</h2>

   <h4>Here’s the practical reality:</h4>

   <h4><span className="span">Skilled PR (189/190/491): job changes are OK, occupation alignment is not optional</span></h4>

   <h4>If you’re going the points-tested route, your priority is ensuring your experience supports:</h4>

   <ul>
    <li>skills assessment requirements (where applicable),</li>
    <li>and accurate points claims (age, English, skilled employment, etc.).</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Job changes are usually fine, <span className="span"> as long as your work remains relevant and provable.</span></h4>
   
   <h2>State nomination: job changes are OK, but location and employability signals matter</h2>

   <h4>For state programs, your job change can help if it strengthens:</h4>

   <ul>
    <li>employability in that state,</li>
    <li>industry alignment,</li>
    <li>regional commitment (where relevant).</li>
   </ul>

   <p>For example, if you’re building a Victoria pathway, you may also be balancing nomination strategies across Melbourne vs regional Victoria. (State programs vary, so this is where strategy matters most.)</p>

   <h4><span className="span">Employer-sponsored PR (186): job changes can reset your timeline</span></h4>

   <p>If your goal is employer-sponsored PR, changing employers can slow you down because PR pathways via employer nomination are tied to employer relationship and eligibility specifics.</p>

   <h2>Optimize your job change so it supports PR, not just salary</h2>

   <h4><span className="span">1 - Keep your nominated occupation “clean” across job changes</span></h4>

   <p>Before switching, test your new role against these questions:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>Do the duties match your nominated occupation (not just the title)?</li>
    <li>Can you explain the role as part of a consistent career narrative?</li>
    <li>Does it strengthen your skills assessment story?</li>
   </ul>

   <p>If your nominated occupation is ICT/Engineering/Accounting/Healthcare, the duty match matters even more.</p>

   <h4><span className="span">2 - Don’t lose the evidence you’ll need 12 months from now</span></h4>

   <p>When people get refused or lose points, it’s rarely because they changed jobs. It’s because later they can’t prove what happened.</p>

   <h4>Create a “PR evidence pack” for each employer:</h4>

   <ul>
    <li>signed contract + job description</li>
    <li>payslips (full set)</li>
    <li>tax summaries / income statements</li>
    <li>superannuation records</li>
    <li>approved leave records (if relevant)</li>
    <li>reference letter with duties + hours + employment period</li>
   </ul>

   <h4><span className="span">3 - Avoid claiming points too early if your “skilled date” isn’t clear</span></h4>

   <p>Some assessing authorities and PR pathways treat the start of skilled employment carefully (for example, depending on your assessment outcome or “date deemed skilled”). Don’t assume every paid week automatically equals points.</p>

   <h4><span className="span">4 - If you’re using SkillSelect: keep your EOI accurate and updated</span></h4>

   <p>
    Once you submit an Expression of Interest, it stays active for 2 years.Your job changes, new experience, and improved English scores may affect points and strategy, so accuracy matters.
   </p>

   <h2>GEO reality check: your job change strategy can differ by city and region</h2>

  <p>Graduates in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide (and regional hubs like Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo) often face different labour markets and nomination patterns.</p>

  <p>If you’re leaning toward a regional pathway, understand what regional actually means for your plan. For Victoria, for example, regional classification can differ from what people assume (many areas outside Melbourne are classified as regional).</p>

  <h2>The 485 advantage: use flexibility without breaking your long-term story</h2>

  <p>Many graduates choose the 485 because it allows them to remain in Australia after study and build local work outcomes.</p>
  <p>
    And in many cases, you can work without the type of hour limits seen on student visas—provided you follow your visa conditions and your grant letter.
  </p>
  <p>
    So yes, job switching can be part of a strong PR plan. But your strategy must stay consistent across these pillars:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><span className="span">Occupation logic</span>(ANZSCO/duties alignment)</li>
    <li>
      <span className="span">Evidence strength</span>(paper trail)</li>
      <li><span className="span">Points discipline</span>(claim only what qualifies)</li>
      <li><span className="span">Pathway clarity</span>(GSM vs state vs sponsorship)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Convert your 485 into a PR-ready plan (without guesswork)</h2>

  <p>If you’re unsure whether a job change will help or hurt, don’t decide based only on salary or title. Decide based on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>which PR pathway you’re targeting,</li>
    <li>what your nominated occupation needs,</li>
    <li>and how your next 6–18 months will look on paper.</li>
  </ul>
